# ClearNews-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-validate-the-authenticity-of-news
This project addresses the critical challenge of fake news detection in the digital age by leveraging machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify news as reliable or deceptive with high accuracy.
Using a labeled dataset of authentic and fabricated articles, advanced preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization are applied to extract textual features. A variety of ML models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
Gradient Boosting, and Random Forests, are implemented and compared for effectiveness, with an ensemble approach proposed to enhance accuracy and robustness. The study underscores the potential of ML-driven systems to combat misinformation and preserve the integrity of information in the digital era.
